                <h2>Arches National Park</h2>
                <p>One of the main things Moab is known for is the national parks nearby. Arches National Park is a must see. Located just 5 miles north of Moab, Arches contains the world's largest concentration of natural sandstone arches. Colossal sandstone fins, massive balanced rocks, soaring pinnacles and spires dwarf visitors as they explore the park's viewpoints and hiking trails. A paved scenic drive takes visitors to many of the major viewpoints within the park. The park will delight children and adults, with many easy trails with easy access to arch exploration.</p>
