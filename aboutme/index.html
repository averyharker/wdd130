    <h2>Avery Harker</h2>
    <p>This is my fifth semester at BYUI and I am studying Web Design and Development. I am from South Jordan, Utah. I have 3 younger siblings, one of which is also attending BYUI. I love being outside, watching movies, being active, and spending time with friends and family. I love going to school at BYUI, I have made a lot of new friends and love how gospel lessons are tied in to secular classes. I am actually retaking this class because I recently switched back to Web Design after doing a few semesters as a different major, I need a refresher!</p>
